# Password-based-Door-Locking-System


**Introduction -

There is a rapid spread of the use of internet today making the world to become a global village. Other forms of advancements in science and technology have also contributed more in this development. It should also be noted that due to this advancements, there is an increasing rate in crime, attacks by thieves, vandals and intruders. 

Despite all the necessary forms of security that has been put in place for the security of information over the internet and properties at homes, more still needs to be done especially in the security of properties and lives at homes, shops and offices.

In most countries that are involved with the use of mechanical locks, the crime rate has increased because these locks are easily broken. It is difficult to always identify who actually had access in to a home or apartment illegally with the mechanical locks. Therefore, there is the need for the use of other types of locks especially the use of electronic locks. 

So, we have made the Password Based Door Locking System Using Arduino & Keypad. So a digital code lock can secure your home or locker easily. It will open your door only when the right password is entered.
